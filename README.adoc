SchemaUI display how to generate dynamically (REST-)Request objects, using a generated UI which use a JSON Schema as definition.
The JSON Schema will be automatically generated for the REST interface.

It exist multiple frameworks/libs which provides a JSON Schema to UI generation. I have integrated the following

* angular-schema-form
* json-editor

Both has similar features. json-editor provides the possibility to convert the Model back to UI; which is with angular-schema-form not possible.
However angular-schema-form provides much more features, to manipulate directly the UI regarding a schema.

Tech stack:

* Spring Boot
* Jackson for JSON Schema Generation
* AngularJS, Bootstrap
